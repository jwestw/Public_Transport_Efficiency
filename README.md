# Public Transport Efficiency Project

This project is currently being carried out by the Data Science Skills Team (DSST) within ONS.

Members involved are [James Westwood](https://github.com/jwestw), [Chloe Murrell](https://github.com/chloemurrell) and [Antonio Felton](https://github.com/Antonio-John).

## Overview
A project to measure the efficiency of public transport systems in the UK. 

By collecting data for thousands of different journeys across multiple cities, the journey time can be compared for public vs private transport  to assess which is considered more 'efficient'.

For clarity, for the purpose of this project efficiency is defined in terms of time efficiency which means to travel to the desired destination while minimising the time and effort required. 

## Aims of the project 

### The concept 
When deciding how to travel into or around a city most people would make the rational decision to choose the mode of transport which will get them to their desired destination the quickest. In London this is public transport however, for many other cities around the UK this is not the case and public transport is in fact much slower. But how much slower and how do different cities compare to London or each other?

This project aims to go beyond current studies by providing comprehensive analysis of public vs private transport clearly demonstrating the efficiency of public transport systems in the UK. Through quantifying journey times within cities throughout the UK and producing a single numerical metric, regional and geographical comparison can be made. 

### Objectives 
The aims of the project are:
- To build a data pipeline that can analyse data to assess the efficiency of public transport systems in the UK. 
- To make the code reusable so that it can be used across numerous cities and the project can be expanded to also consider international cities.
- Conclude with analysis which has the capability of providing insights into the time efficiency of public and private transport and benchmark cities against each other. 

## Process
1.	Take a sample of journeys for a particular city
2.	Calculate journey time metrics for both public and private transport
3.	Calculate a ratio between public and private transport journey times 
4.	Calculate an overall metric for the entire city
5.	Compare the results for each city

## For Developers

### Setting up and Using VS Code 

### Downloading VS Code

You can download VS code from internet [VS code download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Ensure Python is installed on system
If you are unsure if you have python installed, you can find out within the terminal using the following code. 
```python
