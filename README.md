# Project: Public_Transport_Efficiency

## Description
A project to measure the efficiency of public transport systems in the UK. 

By collecting data for thousands of different journeys across multiple cities, numerous parameters, such as journey time and cost, can be compared for public vs private transport  to assess which is considered more 'efficient'.

#### *DEFINITION OF EFFICIENCY?*

## Aims of the project 
The aims of the project are:
- To build a data pipeline that can analyse data to assess the efficiency of public transport systems in the UK. 
- To make the code reusable so that it can be used across numerous cities and the project can be expanded to also consider international cities.
- Conclude with analysis which has the capability of .... 

## Process
1. Take a sample of journeys for a particular city
2. Calculate journey metrics for both public and private transport 
   - Journey time 
   - Cost 
3. Calculate a ratio between public and private transport for the above metrics
4. Calculate an overall metric for the entire city
5. Compare the results for each city
